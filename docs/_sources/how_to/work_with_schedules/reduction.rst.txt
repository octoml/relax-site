Reduction
=========
**Author**: `Tianqi Chen <https://tqchen.github.io>`_

This is an introduction material on how to do reduction in TVM.
Associative reduction operators like sum/max/min are typical
construction blocks of linear algebra operations.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to do reduction in TVM.

Describe Sum of Rows
--------------------
Assume we want to compute sum of rows as our example.
In numpy semantics this can be written as :code:`B = numpy.sum(A, axis=1)`

The following lines describe the row sum operation.
To create a reduction formula, we declare a reduction axis using
:any:`te.reduce_axis`. :any:`te.reduce_axis` takes in the range of reductions.
:any:`te.sum` takes in the expression to be reduced as well as the reduction
axis and compute the sum of value over all k in the declared range.

The equivalent C code is as follows:

.. code-block:: c

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    B[i] = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < m; ++k) {
      B[i] = B[i] + A[i][k];
    }
  }

.. code-block:: default

    n = te.var("n")
    m = te.var("m")
    A = te.placeholder((n, m), name="A")
    k = te.reduce_axis((0, m), "k")
    B = te.compute((n,), lambda i: te.sum(A[i, k], axis=k), name="B")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-74

Schedule the Reduction
----------------------
There are several ways to schedule a reduction.
Before doing anything, let us print out the IR code of default schedule.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-77

.. code-block:: default

    s = te.create_schedule(B.op)
    print(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-84

You can find that the IR code is quite like the C code.
The reduction axis is similar to a normal axis, it can be splitted.

In the following code we split both the row axis of B as well
axis by different factors. The result is a nested reduction.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-88

.. code-block:: default

    ko, ki = s[B].split(B.op.reduce_axis[0], factor=16)
    xo, xi = s[B].split(B.op.axis[0], factor=32)
    print(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 89-90

If we are building a GPU kernel, we can bind the rows of B to GPU threads.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-94

.. code-block:: default

    s[B].bind(xo, te.thread_axis("blockIdx.x"))
    s[B].bind(xi, te.thread_axis("threadIdx.x"))
    print(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-106

Reduction Factoring and Parallelization
---------------------------------------
One problem of building a reduction is that we cannot simply
parallelize over the reduction axis. We need to divide the computation
of the reduction, store the local reduction result in a temporal array
before doing a reduction over the temp array.

The rfactor primitive does such rewrite of the computation.
In the following schedule, the result of B is written to a temporary
result B.rf. The factored dimension becomes the first dimension of B.rf.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-111

.. code-block:: default

    s = te.create_schedule(B.op)
    ko, ki = s[B].split(B.op.reduce_axis[0], factor=16)
    BF = s.rfactor(B, ki)
    print(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 112-115

The scheduled operator of B also get rewritten to be sum over
the first axis of reduced result of B.f


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-117

.. code-block:: default

    print(s[B].op.body)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 118-130

Cross Thread Reduction
----------------------
We can now parallelize over the factored axis.
Here the reduction axis of B is marked to be a thread.
TVM allows reduction axis to be marked as thread if it is the only
axis in reduction and cross thread reduction is possible in the device.

This is indeed the case after the factoring.
We can directly compute BF at the reduction axis as well.
The final generated kernel will divide the rows by blockIdx.x and threadIdx.y
columns by threadIdx.x and finally do a cross thread reduction over threadIdx.x


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 130-140

.. code-block:: default

    xo, xi = s[B].split(s[B].op.axis[0], factor=32)
    s[B].bind(xo, te.thread_axis("blockIdx.x"))
    s[B].bind(xi, te.thread_axis("threadIdx.y"))
    tx = te.thread_axis("threadIdx.x")
    s[B].bind(s[B].op.reduce_axis[0], tx)
    s[BF].compute_at(s[B], s[B].op.reduce_axis[0])
    s[B].set_store_predicate(tx.var.equal(0))
    fcuda = tvm.build(s, [A, B], "cuda")
    print(fcuda.imported_modules[0].get_source())

Verify the correctness of result kernel by comparing it to numpy.

    nn = 128
    dev = tvm.cuda(0)
    a = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=(nn, nn)).astype(A.dtype), dev)
    b = tvm.nd.array(np.zeros(nn, dtype=B.dtype), dev)
    fcuda(a, b)
    tvm.testing.assert_allclose(b.numpy(), np.sum(a.numpy(), axis=1), rtol=1e-4)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 151-156

Describe Convolution via 2D Reduction
-------------------------------------
In TVM, we can describe convolution via 2D reduction in a simple way.
Here is an example for 2D convolution with filter size = [3, 3] and strides = [1, 1].


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 156-169

.. code-block:: default

    n = te.var("n")
    Input = te.placeholder((n, n), name="Input")
    Filter = te.placeholder((3, 3), name="Filter")
    di = te.reduce_axis((0, 3), name="di")
    dj = te.reduce_axis((0, 3), name="dj")
    Output = te.compute(
        (n - 2, n - 2),
        lambda i, j: te.sum(Input[i + di, j + dj] * Filter[di, dj], axis=[di, dj]),
        name="Output",
    )
    s = te.create_schedule(Output.op)
    print(tvm.lower(s, [Input, Filter, Output], simple_mode=True))

Define General Commutative Reduction Operation
----------------------------------------------
Besides the built-in reduction operations like :any:`te.sum`,
:any:`tvm.te.min` and :any:`tvm.te.max`, you can also define your
commutative reduction operation by :any:`te.comm_reducer`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 178-186

.. code-block:: default


    n = te.var("n")
    m = te.var("m")
    product = te.comm_reducer(lambda x, y: x * y, lambda t: tvm.tir.const(1, dtype=t), name="product")
    A = te.placeholder((n, m), name="A")
    k = te.reduce_axis((0, m), name="k")
    B = te.compute((n,), lambda i: product(A[i, k], axis=k), name="B")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 187-192

.. note::

  Sometimes we would like to perform reduction that involves multiple
  values like :code:`argmax`, which can be done by tuple inputs.
  See :ref:`reduction-with-tuple-inputs` for more detail.
